# Ultima Cloud Platform

## What is Ultima?
Ultima is an open source, Infrastructure-as-Code cloud platform with built-in CI and local development environment.
Push your code, tell Ultima how your services are set up, what components you need (databases, S3 buckets, etc.), and instantly have your production, staging, and development environment live.


**👩‍💻 Develop with confidence** 

Use the Ultima CLI to develop and test in a byte-for-byte identical cloud environment to production before pushing.

**👀 Easily preview changes**

Creating preview environments is as easy as pushing a new branch.

**🔁 Version your infrastructure**

Configuration is stored in a `.ultima.yml` file in your repository. Changes made through our dashboard are commits (or pull requests) to that branch, and testable through the CLI.
