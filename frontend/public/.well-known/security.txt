# Hello World!
# We're a bootstrapped startup so don't have a structured bug bounty program (yet) but we do offer:
# Thanks - Everyone that submits a new bug gets acknowledged on our acknowledgements page
# Swag - If you submit something we deem medium severity or higher we'll send you some swag
# Dinner - If you submit something of high severity which really saves our bacon, we'll buy you pizza, if it's critical you get a steak dinner, on us!
